Scenarios (Problem Definition & Requirements Analysis)
E.g.
Nkosi Doe is a clothing designer from Point Fortin. He has just designed prints for a new series of Carnival party 
t-shirts. He wants people to know about these t-shirts so that he takes photos of them and adds them to his Facebook
page dedicated to his brand (N-Doe). His facebook page has about 500 followers many of them already his friends and contacts.
He also posts a few of the pictures on his Instagram feed as well as in Whatsapp groups. 
These promotion and advertising methods are free and he hopes to get as much traction as possible for them.
He also wants to post the photos to a site with various collections of local fashion wear because he believes
there will be a diverse group of customers and shoppers there who are not already within his immediate circle of contacts.
He wants that he can post his photos, list the description of the items, their prices and where people can purchase them. 
He also wants that people are able to purchase them from the site directly. He is willing to pay a subscription for the 
ability to list items on the store. (Does this scenario seem realistic? Would people choose a site they must pay to display
wares on over the standard Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp?)
